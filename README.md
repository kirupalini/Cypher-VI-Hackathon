# Cypher-VI-Hackathon

A website to analyse covid-19 data by country and search with twitter handles to get updates on the same.

The countrywise Covid-19 dataset was collected from https://data-flair.training/blogs/download-covid-19-dataset/.

The website is built using Python flask, HTML, CSS and Bootstrap.

The app.py script encompasses two routes, one is to read the data, list the top 10 countries based on no.of confirmed cases and visualise it in the world map, the other is to post the live tweets on the website based on the twitter handle provided by the user in the search bar.
